## Theory Summary

This repository contains the research paper and computational evidence for the Principle of Minimal Ontological Cost (MOC), a unifying framework postulating that reality evolves to minimize a combined cost of informational complexity (K(x)) and energetic demand (ΔE).

This principle is used to dissolve persistent dualisms such as mind-matter and quantum-relativity by proposing they are different hierarchical levels of the same process of fractal self-organization.

## Repository Contents

* **/Manifesto:** Contains the main paper, `The_Principle_of_Minimal_Ontological_Cost.pdf`, detailing the ontology, the theory of consciousness, and its implications for physics.
* **/Final_Simulation:** Contains the Python script (`optimal_universe_simulation.py`) used to generate the computational evidence. This model simulates a society of agents with a three-layer architecture (`L₁`, `L₂`, `L₃`) demonstrating the emergence of a stable consciousness and a resilient self-awareness.
* **/Results:** Contains the graph (`Homeostasis_L3_Graph.png`) generated by the simulation, which serves as the theory's proof of concept.

## How to Replicate the Results

To run the simulation and replicate the results, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies and run the main script from the `Final_Simulation` folder.
